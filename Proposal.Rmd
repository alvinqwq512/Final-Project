## The tentative project title
*ParkScope — Patterns, People, and Places in NYC Special Events*


## The motivation for this project

New York sells itself on vibrant public life—but a city’s real magnetism shows up in how well it shares its spaces and resources. Recreation and cultural events can boost health, knit communities together, and energize neighborhoods. Yet across NYC, population density, demographics, and access to parks vary dramatically. Are we programming public events where people actually are—and where they’re most needed?
Using NYC Parks’ Special Events data (one-off fitness, sports, dance, film, and concert events), we will map and model how event types distribute across the city’s geography and population patterns. Our goal is to surface clustering, gaps, and inequities, identifying neighborhoods saturated with options versus areas underserved. The findings can inform more equitable programming, guiding agencies and partners to place the right events in the right places, and ultimately make NYC’s public realm more inclusive, healthy, and alive.

## The intended final products

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**          
Descriptive statistics: Descriptive analyses of NYC Parks special events, focusing on event types, frequency, duration, and geographic distribution across boroughs and seasons. We will summarize how event activity varies by time of year, park location, and event category.   


**Spatial and Temporal Analysis:**       
Using interactive mapping tools and time-series visualizations, we will explore spatial clustering and seasonal trends in park events. This analysis will identify whether certain boroughs or neighborhoods host more frequent events and how park activity changes over time.

 
**Equity and Accessibility Assessment:**        
Using demographic and population data from the U.S. Census and NYC Open Data, we will evaluate the relationship between event locations and neighborhood characteristics (e.g., population density, socioeconomic indicators). This analysis will help assess whether public events are equitably distributed among communities.



## The anticipated data sources
Dataset will be the [*Parks Special Events*](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Recreation/Parks-Special-Events/6v4b-5gp4/about_data) from *NYC Open Data*. This data set includes detailed information on public events held in New York City parks.  
Relevant indices include:  
- Group Name/Partner    
- Borough     
- Location      
- Event Name & Type     
- Attendance      
- Category

We will also use population data from [Census.gov](https://data.census.gov/).


## The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges
To clean the data, we will standardize column names, trim and fix text, parse the date-time into useful parts (date, year, month), normalize event type and category, split the audience field into flags (kids, teens, adults, seniors, general). We then join neighborhoods and population counts so we can calculate events per 10,000 residents for the equity view.

Our analysis will start with a clear descriptive overview. We will count events by borough, neighborhood, event type, partner, and audience (kids, teens, adults, seniors). We will check when events happen during the year and which places host them most often. Next, we will build a “seasonality fingerprint”: a month-by-event-type summary for each borough to show peaks and dips. We will also examine spatial patterns to see clusters and gaps across neighborhoods. To assess equity, we will join population data and compare population density with event frequency. We will also compare audience tags across places (for example, whether kids’ events are evenly available).

Using `leaflet`, Users can explore a map (points or heat) and filter by borough, neighborhood, event type, audience, and date range. Trend panels will show seasonal/monthly totals and audience mix. Each result will have an event card with time, place, type, and audience.

Our main coding challenges are data cleaning and mapping. The Audience column is not standardized, so we must split multi-value strings and map many variants to flags. To generate an interactive map, geocoding is required because the dataset only includes the names of the parks as locations.
